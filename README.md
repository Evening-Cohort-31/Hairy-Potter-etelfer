# The Hairy Potter

In this project, your task to build a workflow for making, and firing pottery, and then determining if it should be sold at a craft show. Then you will display the pottery to be sold in the DOM.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Setup

```sh
cd hairy-potter
cd src
code .
```

1. Run the `serve` command to start the web server.
1. Open the URL provided by `serve` in your browser.

## Requirements

### Making Pottery at the Wheel

1. Create a `scripts/PotteryWheel.js` module.
1. Define a variable in the module to have the value of the primary key for each piece of pottery. It should have an initial value of 1.
1. Define and export a function named `makePottery`.
1. The `makePottery` function must accept the following values as input _(i.e. it needs parameters)_, in the following order.
   1. Shape of the piece of pottery (e.g. "Mug", "Platter")
   1. Weight of the piece (e.g. 1, 5)
   1. Height of the piece (e.g. 3, 7)
1. The `makePottery` function must return an object with the following properties on it.
   1. `shape`
   1. `weight`
   1. `height`
   1. `id` _(increment this value each time the function is invoked)_

#### Checking Your Work

In the `main.js` module, invoke the `makePottery` function and provide the required values as arguments. Store the object that gets returned into a variable, and then use `console.log()` to view the object.

Once you have it working, make 5 pieces of pottery in `main.js`.

### Firing the Pottery in the Kiln

1. Define a `scripts/Kiln.js` module.
1. Define and export a function named `firePottery` that is responsible for acting as a kiln.
1. The function must accept the following values as input _(i.e. it needs parameters)_, in the following order. If you don't remember, you can easily [add new properties to objects in JavaScript](https://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/object-literal/properties.php).
   1. An object representing a piece of pottery that was made at the wheel in the `makePottery` function.
   1. A number specifying the firing temperature of the kiln.
1. The function must add a new property of `fired` with the value of `true` to the object.
1. The function must add a new property of `cracked` to the object.
   1. If the temperature of the kiln is above 2200 degrees then `cracked` property must have a value of `true`.
   1. If the temperature of the kiln is at, or below, 2200 degrees then `cracked` property must have a value of `false`.
1. After both of the new properties have been added, return the augmented object.

#### Checking Your Work

In the `main.js` module, invoke the `firePottery` function for each of the 5 pieces of pottery you created. Ensure you provide the required values as arguments. Store the object that gets returned into a variable, and then use `console.log()` to view the objects and make sure it has the right properties on each.

To check your work, make sure that at least one of your pieces of pottery is fired at a temperature that is too high.

### Pricing Uncracked Pottery

1. Create a `scripts/PotteryCatalog.js` module.
1. Define a variable in the module with a value of an empty array. This array will store pottery that will be sold. Do not export this array.
1. Define and export a function named `toSellOrNotToSell` that is responsible for determining if a piece of pottery should be sold.
1. The `toSellOrNotToSell` function must accept a pottery object as input.
1. If the weight of the piece of pottery is greater than, or equal to, 6 then the function must add a `price` property with a value of 40.
1. If the weight of the piece of pottery is less than 6 then the function must add a `price` property with a value of 20.
1. If the piece of pottery is cracked, do not add a `price` property to it.
1. If the pottery is **not** cracked, add the object to the module-level array of items to be sold.
1. Return the augmented object.
1. Define and export a function named `usePottery` returns a copy of the array of items to be sold. Recall which global javascript function creates a deep copy of values.

#### Checking Your Work

In the `main.js` module, invoke the `toSellOrNotToSell` function for each of the 5 pieces of pottery you created. Ensure you provide the required value as an argument.

### Display the Catalog

Your next task is to create HTML representations of the pottery you want to sell at the craft fair and display them on the DOM. Then you will track which ones you sell.

#### Define DOM Target

1. Create an `<article>` element in the `index.html` file.
1. The article element must have a class of `potteryList`.

#### Create Pottery HTML

1. Create a `scripts/PotteryList.js` module.
1. Define and export a `PotteryList` function.
1. The `PotteryList` function must get the items to be sold from the `PotteryCatalog.js` module.
1. The `PotteryList` function must convert each object in the array to an HTML representation string. Use the following template to generate the representations.
   ```html
   <section class="pottery" id="pottery--1">
     <h2 class="pottery__shape">Mug</h2>
     <div class="pottery__properties">
       Item weighs 3 grams and is 6 cm in height
     </div>
     <div class="pottery__price">Price is $20</div>
   </section>
   ```
1. The `PotteryList` function must then return a single string that contains ALL of the pottery HTML representation.

#### Checking Your Work

In the `main.js` module, invoke the `PotteryList` component function. Take its return value and update the inner HTML of the article element you created above. When you start your web server, you should see your non-cracked pottery list appear (_example below_).

## Vocabulary and Understanding

> ðŸ§¨ Before you click the "Assessment Complete" button on the Learning Platform, add your answers below for each question and make a commit. It is your option to request a face-to-face meeting with a coach for a vocabulary review.

1. Explain how you got the HTML, with the correct data, displayed in the browser?

   > I defined a function called potteryList. When defining the function I first had it create a variable that would be a string of HTML. Then I created a for of loop that would iterate over each object in the array of sellable pottery that I would use as an argument when invoking the function. I set the parameter as usePottery because this is a function that when invoked returns the deep copy of the array of sellable objects that I had already created using a different function in a separate module. After each object in the array iterates through the for of loop, the HTML string that is generated is added to the variable I initially created which I had labeled potteryHTML. Then, in the main.js module, I created a variable named sellablePottery with the value set as the invocation of the usePottery function. I then created another variable named potteryHTML with its value set as the invocation of the potteryList function using the sellablePottery array that I just defined as the argument. When this ran, it generated the HTML string needed to display on the DOM. In order to do this, I used the document.querySelector('.potteryList').innerHTML = potteryHTML line of code to select the article â€˜potteryListâ€™ that I had created and insert it into the inner HTML of the browser in order for it to be displayed.

2. In the **PotteryList** module, when you iterate your pottery, you need to show the evidence of what the **weight** property's value is for the 2nd piece of pottery. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) to record your browser window with the developer tools open and show those values.

   (https://www.loom.com/share/546e363a473f49af8392f852c0b41c49?sid=fba3bf44-614b-4fe4-8004-7214b93ba600)

3. The **PotteryWheel** module has a single function named `makePottery`. Why doesn't that module have all of the other code in it?

That is the first module that is defining the function being used to make all of the initial pottery objects. We use different modules for each of the other sections of code because they all have a different purpose and it would get confusing to have it all in one module. Modularizing helps to keep code clean and make it easy to understand what each modules purpose is in order to refer back to it and explain to other developers if in the future that is needed. We also put a lot of the other code into main.js because that is where we are invoking the functions that are individually defined in their separate modules in order to see it all being invoked in one place, basically where we create the objects and see the return of all of the previously defined functions.

4. The pottery shop has learned that there is a set of customers that are willing to buy cracked pottery at a discounted price of $2.50. That means that the cracked pottery should now be displayed in the catalog. Explain the changes that this new business strategy would cause to your algorithm.

 This would mean that I need to go back into the potteryCatalog module and add another else if statement that would state that if firePottery.fired !== true then the firedPottery.price === 2.50 and then would push that into the sellable pottery array as well. 

      else if (firedPottery.fired !== true) {
        firedPottery.price = 2.50
        sellablePottery.push(firedPottery)
    }

5. In the **Kiln** module, you have a `firePottery()` function. You need to demonstrate how to use the debugger to verify the values of the parameters for that function when your code runs. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) to record your browser window with the developer tools open and show those values.
